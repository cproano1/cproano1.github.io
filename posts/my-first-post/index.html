Who needs cards when you can conveniently play casino games on your computer? Well for that reason, I attempted to code a simplified version of Poker on Python. Initially, I imported random and created the lists suits (containing the four suits), faces, hands, and highest_card. Faces has the integer values from 1 to 14, representing the card values, so that the face cards are highest (Ace is 14)." />

<p>Who needs cards when you can conveniently play casino games on your computer? Well for that reason, I attempted to code a simplified version of Poker on Python.
Initially, I imported random and created the lists suits (containing the four suits), faces, hands, and highest_card. Faces has the integer values from 1 to 14, representing the card values, so that the face cards are highest (Ace is 14). Hands and Highest_card are empty and are filled later.
The only argument is NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS, which then corresponds to the number of hands that are played. I then wrote a nested for loop that first goes through the number of hands (which is the number of players) then through the 5 cards in each of hand. The program then prints out the all of the hands of each player.
I then created two more variables, winning_player = None and winning_card = 2, before another use of the same nested loop. Winning_player is shown at the end of the program after the highest card is found among each hand. The ranking of the faces are reversed in the list rank to show that 14 (an Ace) is the highest card. A third loop is placed in to compare all of the numbers in the hands. The highest hand is set equal to winning_card.
The game at the end puts out the player that won and their winning card.<br />
